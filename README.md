# Nedoc (Non-Evaluating Documentation)

* *Nedoc* is generator of API documentation for Python 3
* *Nedoc* does not run the code of the application/library for which the
  documentation is generated; *Nedoc* scans its source codes. The
  application/library and its dependencies does not have to be installed.
* *Nedoc* tracks what methods was overridden and shows it in the documentation.
* *Nedoc* supports documentation inheritance of overridden methods.
* *Nedoc* tracks what and where was reimported.

# Examples

* Django documentation generated by Nedoc: https://spirali.github.io/nedoc-demo/django/django.html

# Installation

```
$ pip3 install nedoc
```

# Getting started

First, we need to generate `nedoc.conf`; <PathToProject> should lead to toplevel
directory with Python source codes (i.e. directory containing toplevel
`__init__.py`).


```
python3 -m nedoc init <ProjectName> <PathToProject>
```

This command creates `nedoc.conf` in the current working directory. You can edit
it for more customized settings.

Building the documentation:

```
python3 -m nedoc build
```
